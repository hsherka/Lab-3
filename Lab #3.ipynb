    "In this lab, I took data on New York's distribution of lottery money towards school aid in the years 2002 - 2017. From this, I looked for and found the most aid given, the least aid given, average aid given, median aid given to each school district, and the difference between the minimum and maximum amount of aid given. I got this data from data.gov, I know it is reputable because it is a government website. This is the link to the untouched data set https://data.ny.gov/api/views/9ypc-vjig/rows.csv . "

    " I found that the most aid given to a school district in New York State from lottery funds was \\$1,337,283,719, and the least aid given to a shcool district was \\$105. I did not know how to index a dataframe, so I could not attach these numbers to the specific school district that recieved these amounts. The average aid given was \\$4,063,464.25. Two new things I was able to discover in this lab using the numpy package were the median aid, and the difference of aid given between the district that recieved the most and the district that recieved the least aid. The median aid given was \\$1337283719, and the difference between the max and min aid given to any school district was \\$1337283614. This information made me wonder how a school district could make \\$105 when the average given is millions of dollars more than that. It also made me wonder how the money given to districts from the lottery is distributed. These are questions up for future investigation. \n"
